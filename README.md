I make the config for myself, if desired, you can remove the settings for hyprsome (for several monitors). I took other developments and remade them for myself. Here's what I got:
![2025-03-03-155837_hyprshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8456205-6e81-4d77-83ad-9c2b4168f95b)

Besides hyprsome, there are hyprpaper and hyprshot (with default settings).
  **Icons and themes:** graphite-gtk-theme, papirus icon.
If someone liked it, you can take it and if you want to edit it for yourself.
  **Thank you for your attention**
